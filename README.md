# Financial Analytics Report

## Project Overview
This project analyzes financial performance, identifies key profitability drivers, and provides actionable insights. The report visualizes revenue, profit trends, expenses, and discount impacts, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
- **Total Revenue:** $118.73M, yet the profit margin is **14.23%**, highlighting the significance of expense management.
- **Revenue by Segment:** Government & Small Businesses lead in revenue, but profit margins differ significantly.
- **Discount Impact:** Low-discount bands contribute the highest profit, whereas high discounts reduce margins.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Profit surges towards the end of the year, indicating strong seasonal effects.

##  Dashboard Visuals
The Power BI report consists of three main sections:
1. **Financial Performance Overview** â€“ Revenue, profit, expenses, and sales breakdown by segment, country, and product.
2. **Profit Analysis & Key Drivers** â€“ Profit trends over time, breakdown by discount bands, and comparison of gross sales vs. profit.
3. **Expense Distribution & Margin Analysis** â€“ Monthly revenue vs. expenses, expenses by segment, and profit margins across discount bands.

##  Strategic Business Recommendations
- **Optimize Discount Strategies:** High-discount bands significantly lower profit margins. A refined pricing strategy can maximize profitability.
- **Target High-Performing Segments:** Government and Small Business segments drive revenue, but optimizing costs in these areas can improve margins.
- **Leverage Seasonal Trends:** Investing in marketing and operational efficiency during peak months can enhance revenue and profit growth.
